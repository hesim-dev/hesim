\title{List of survival distributions}
\format{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{name}{Name of the probability distribution.}
\item{pars}{Vector of strings naming the parameters of the distribution.
These must be the same names as the arguments of the density and
probability functions.}
\item{location}{Name of the location parameter.}
\item{transforms}{List of R functions which transform the range of values
taken by each parameter onto the real line. For example,
\code{c(log, log)} for a distribution with two positive parameters.}
\item{inv.transforms}{List of R functions defining the corresponding
inverse transformations. Note these must be lists, even for single
parameter distributions they should be supplied as, e.g.
\code{c(exp) or list(exp)}.}
\item{inits}{A function of the observed survival times \code{t} (including
right-censoring times, and using the halfway point for interval-censored
times) which returns a vector of reasonable initial values for maximum
likelihood estimation of each parameter. For example,
\code{function(t){ c(1, mean(t)) }} will always initialize the first of
two parameters at 1, and the second (a scale parameter, for instance) at
the mean of \code{t}.}

\description{
List of additional distributions for parametric survival analysis that are
not contained in \code{\link[flexsurv:flexsurv-package]{flexsurv}}. Can be used to fit models
with \code{\link[flexsurv:flexsurvreg]{flexsurv::flexsurvreg()}}. Same format as
\code{\link[flexsurv:flexsurvreg]{flexsurv::flexsurv.dists}}.
