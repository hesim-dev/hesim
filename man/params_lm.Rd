\title{Parameters of a linear model}
\usage{
params_lm(coefs, sigma = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{coefs}{Samples of the coefficients under sampling uncertainty.
Must be a matrix or any object coercible to a matrix such as \code{data.frame}
or \code{data.table}.}

\item{sigma}{A vector of samples of the standard error of the regression model.
Default value is 1 for all samples. Only used if the model is
used to randomly simulate values (rather than to predict means).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{params_lm}, which is a list containing \code{coefs},
\code{sigma}, and \code{n_samples}. \code{n_samples} is equal to the
number of rows in \code{coefs}. The \code{coefs} element is always converted into a
matrix.
}
\description{
Create a list containing the parameters of a fitted linear regression model.
}
\details{
Fitted linear models are used to predict values, \eqn{y},
as a function of covariates, \eqn{x},
\deqn{y = x^T\beta + \epsilon.}
Predicted means are given by \eqn{x^T\hat{\beta}} where \eqn{\hat{\beta}}
is the vector of estimated regression coefficients. Random samples are obtained by
sampling the error term from a normal distribution,
\eqn{\epsilon \sim N(0, \hat{\sigma}^2)}{\epsilon ~ N(0, \hat{\sigma}^2)}.

  coefs = mvrnorm(n,
    mu = c(.5, .6),
    Sigma = matrix(c(.05, .01, .01, .05), nrow = 2)
  ),
  sigma <- rgamma(n, shape = .5, rate = 4)

This parameter object is useful for modeling \link[=StateVals]{health state values}
when values can vary across patients and/or health states as a function of
covariates. In many cases it will, however, be simpler, and more flexible to
use a \code{\link{stateval_tbl}}. For an example use case see the documentation for
\code{\link[=create_StateVals.lm]{create_StateVals.lm()}}.
