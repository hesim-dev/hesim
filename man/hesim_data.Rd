\title{Data for health economic simulation modeling}
\usage{
hesim_data(strategies, patients, states = NULL, transitions = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{strategies}{A table of treatment strategies. Must contain the column
\code{strategy_id} denoting a unique strategy. Other columns are variables
describing the characteristics of a treatment strategy.}

\item{patients}{A table of patients. Must contain the column \code{patient_id} denoting
a unique patient. The number of rows should be equal to the number of patients
in the model. The table may also include columns for \code{grp_id} for subgroups and
\code{patient_wt} specifying the weight to apply to each patient (within a subgroup).
If \code{grp_id} is \code{NULL}, then it is assumed that there is only one subgroup. If
\code{patient_wt} is \code{NULL}. then each patient is given the same weight. Weights
cannot be used in individual-level models because each patient should be
weighted equally; that is, weights can only be specified in cohort models.
Weights within subgroups are normalized to sum to one. Other columns are
variables describing the characteristics of a patient.}

\item{states}{A table of health states. Must contain the column
\code{state_id}, which denotes a unique health state. The number of rows should
be equal to the number of health states in the model. Other columns can describe the
characteristics of a health state.}

\item{transitions}{A table of health state transitions. Must contain the column
\code{transition_id}, which denotes a unique transition; \code{from}, which denotes
the starting health state; and \code{to} which denotes the state that will be
transitioned to.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class \code{hesim_data}, which is a list of data tables for
health economic simulation modeling.
}
\description{
A list of tables required for health economic simulation modeling. This object
is used to setup models by defining the treatment strategies, target population,
and model structure.
}
\note{
Each table must either be a \code{data.frame} or \code{data.table}. All ID variables
within each table must be numeric vectors of integers and should be of the form
1,2,...N where N is the number of unique values of the ID variable.
